This section will showcase research data from the development process, for users interested in further development. The data will be continuously updated.

## Tension Limit Testing

**Test Environment**  
- NEMA23 57 Stepper Motor (2-phase, 4-wire, 1.8Â°, 1.2Nm)  
- DC 19V 4A Power Supply  
- TB6600 Driver, Current Setting: 3.5A  
- Software Version: V2.71, Speed Setting: L9

| Slide/Lead Screw | TB6600 STEP/REV | Maximum Tension |  
|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| SGX 1610         | 4/800(Fast)     | 70LB            |
| SGX 1610         | 8/1600(Slow)    | 80LB            |
| GX80 1610        | 4/800(Fast)     | 70LB            |
| GX80 1610        | 8/1600(Slow)    | 80LB            |
| GX80 1605        | 4/800(Fast)     | 120LB           |

> [!NOTE]  
> The test standard involves performing 10 consecutive tension tests without the motor experiencing any step loss (slipping).

> [!NOTE]  
> Due to variations in the quality of slides from different suppliers, the above data is for reference only.
