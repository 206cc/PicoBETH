# Operation and Settings Guide

## User Interface

The following demonstrates the user interface of version V2.80.

### Main Screen

- Use the Exit button to start the timer function. Press it again to stop the timer, and a third time to reset the timer.

1. Set LB  
2. Set KG  
3. Status Display  
4. PS = Pre-stretch Function, KT = Knotting Function  
5. Stringing Timer Time  
6. Clip head movement speed: 1 = slowest, 9 = fastest  
7. Constant-pull Status C = Enabled, M = Disabled  
8. Current Tension Value (Grams)  

### Tension Setting Screen

- Press the five-way button to enter tension setting mode. The first press displays the maximum tension with pre-stretch included. The second press adjusts the tension and pre-stretch.
- The pre-stretch function (PS) and knotting function (KT) can be toggled with the up and down buttons. After knotting, it automatically switches back to pre-stretch.

1. Maximum tension including pre-stretch  
2. Maximum tension including pre-stretch  

### Tensioning Screen

- When the set tension is reached, the constant-pull mode is activated. Tension increases if it's too low, or decreases if too high, until tensioning mode is ended by pressing the button on the clamp head or the Exit button.
- Press the middle button of the five-way button to disable constant-pull. Press again to re-enable it.
- Pressing up or down adjusts tension by 0.5LB.

1. Set Tension  
2. Current Tension  
3. A countdown starts when the set tension is reached  
4. Clip head speed: 1 = slowest, 9 = fastest  
5. Constant-pull Status C = Enabled, M = Disabled  
6. Difference from set tension in grams (displays +++ if over 99G, --- if under 99G)  

### Settings Screen

![img_setting](img_setting.jpg)

1. SP: Clip head speed (1 = slowest, 9 = fastest)  
2. CP: Constant-pull on/off  
3. BZ: Buzzer on/off  
4. UN: Set LB or KG  
5. HX: HX711 Tension Sensor Calibration  
6. I: System Information  
7. T: Total Tension Count/Log  

### System Information

![img_sysinfo](img_sysinfo.jpg)

1. Software Version and Date  
2. HX711 Tension Amplifier Info (Drift Value/Tension Baseline Value/RATE Hz)  
3. Clamp head speed and steps  
4. Stepper motor speed  
5. Tension parameters  
6. Boot count  
7. Total tension count  

### Engineering Menu

Starting from version v2.90, initial hardware parameter setup has been greatly simplified. You can now configure all parameters directly via the **Engineering Menu**, without needing a computer.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Please make sure to correctly configure hardware parameters on first boot. Incorrect settings may cause serious damage to the racket.**

#### How to Enter the Engineering Menu

You can enter the engineering menu using either of the following methods:

1. **During startup**: When the version info and progress bar are displayed, press the **left directional key**.
2. **From the Settings Page**: In the INFO menu, press the **down directional key** 5 times consecutively.

#### 9-1 Load Cell Selection

Please select the appropriate load cell rating based on your hardware:

- **20kg**
- **50kg**

#### 9-2 Maximum Tension Setting

Starting from v2.90, the tennis mode has been removed. The system now sets the maximum tension based on the load cell type and platform used:

| Load Cell Rating | Platform Type | Recommended Max Tension  |
|------------------|----------------|---------------------------|
| 20kg             | SGX 1610       | 40lb                      |
| 50kg             | SGX 1610       | 70lb                      |
| 50kg             | GX80 1605      | 90lb+ (Limit: 130lb)      |

> [!WARNING]
> Please ensure the machineâ€™s structure can withstand the configured maximum tension.

> [!WARNING]
> Applying tension beyond the rated load cell limit may damage the sensor and drastically shorten its lifespan.

#### 9-3 Bead Clip Tensioning Mode

Select the appropriate bead clip tensioning mode:

- **Standard Mode**
- **Enhanced Mode**

## Pre-stretching Method

The pre-stretching method of PicoBETH is divided into three stages. Using 20LB with a 10% pre-stretch as an example, the process is as follows:

- **Stage 1:** When the pre-stretching tension (22LB) is reached, the motor stops and emits a 0.3-second long beep.  
- **Stage 2:** The motor slowly retreats to the specified tension (20LB).  
- **Stage 3:** Once the tension touches the specified value (20LB), the system emits a 0.1-second short beep and activates the constant-pull system.

To accommodate my stringing habit, PicoBETH's pre-stretching method is slightly different from commercial machines. During Stage 2, the tension does not drop below the specified value. Upon hearing the 0.3-second long beep in Stage 1, I immediately release the clamp, allowing the previous string to also benefit from the pre-stretch tension. In theory, this helps ensure the strings are straighter. If you prefer the pre-stretching method of commercial machines, the program can be easily modified to achieve this.
