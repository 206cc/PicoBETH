## User Interface

The following demonstrates the user interface of version V2.80.

### Main Screen

- Use the Exit button to start the timer function. Press it again to stop the timer, and a third time to reset the timer.

1. Set LB  
2. Set KG  
3. Status Display  
4. PS = Pre-stretch Function, KT = Knotting Function  
5. Stringing Timer Time  
6. Clip head movement speed: 1 = slowest, 9 = fastest  
7. Constant-pull Status C = Enabled, M = Disabled  
8. Current Tension Value (Grams)  

### Tension Setting Screen

- Press the five-way button to enter tension setting mode. The first press displays the maximum tension with pre-stretch included. The second press adjusts the tension and pre-stretch.
- The pre-stretch function (PS) and knotting function (KT) can be toggled with the up and down buttons. After knotting, it automatically switches back to pre-stretch.

1. Maximum tension including pre-stretch  
2. Maximum tension including pre-stretch  

### Tensioning Screen

- When the set tension is reached, the constant-pull mode is activated. Tension increases if it's too low, or decreases if too high, until tensioning mode is ended by pressing the button on the clamp head or the Exit button.
- Press the middle button of the five-way button to disable constant-pull. Press again to re-enable it.
- Pressing up or down adjusts tension by 0.5LB.

1. Set Tension  
2. Current Tension  
3. A countdown starts when the set tension is reached  
4. Clip head speed: 1 = slowest, 9 = fastest  
5. Constant-pull Status C = Enabled, M = Disabled  
6. Difference from set tension in grams (displays +++ if over 99G, --- if under 99G)  

### Settings Screen

![img_setting](img_setting.jpg)

1. SP: Clip head speed (1 = slowest, 9 = fastest)  
2. CP: Constant-pull on/off  
3. BZ: Buzzer on/off  
4. UN: Set LB or KG  
5. HX: HX711 Tension Sensor Calibration  
6. I: System Information  
7. T: Total Tension Count/Log  

### System Information

![img_sysinfo](img_sysinfo.jpg)

1. Software Version and Date  
2. HX711 Tension Amplifier Info (Drift Value/Tension Baseline Value/RATE Hz)  
3. Clamp head speed and steps  
4. Stepper motor speed  
5. Tension parameters  
6. Boot count  
7. Total tension count  

### Engineering Menu

Starting from version v2.90, initial hardware parameter setup has been greatly simplified. You can now configure all parameters directly via the **Engineering Menu**, without needing a computer.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Please make sure to correctly configure hardware parameters on first boot. Incorrect settings may cause serious damage to the racket.**

#### How to Enter the Engineering Menu

You can enter the engineering menu using either of the following methods:

1. **During startup**: When the version info and progress bar are displayed, press the **left directional key**.
2. **From the Settings Page**: In the INFO menu, press the **down directional key** 5 times consecutively.

#### 9-1 Load Cell Selection

Please select the appropriate load cell rating based on your hardware:

- **20kg**
- **50kg**

#### 9-2 Maximum Tension Setting

Starting from v2.90, the tennis mode has been removed. The system now sets the maximum tension based on the load cell type and platform used:

| Load Cell Rating | Platform Type | Recommended Max Tension  |
|------------------|----------------|---------------------------|
| 20kg             | SGX 1610       | 40lb                      |
| 50kg             | SGX 1610       | 70lb                      |
| 50kg             | GX80 1605      | 90lb+ (Limit: 130lb)      |

> [!WARNING]
> Please ensure the machine’s structure can withstand the configured maximum tension.

> [!WARNING]
> Applying tension beyond the rated load cell limit may damage the sensor and drastically shorten its lifespan.

#### 9-3 Bead Clip Tensioning Mode

Select the appropriate bead clip tensioning mode:

- **Standard Mode**
- **Enhanced Mode**

## Wi-Fi OTA Firmware Update Instructions

Starting from **v2.90**, PicoBETH supports **OTA firmware updates via Wi-Fi**. Please follow the instructions below:

### Requirements

1. Only compatible with **Raspberry Pi Pico W** models that have Wi-Fi functionality  
2. Make sure the file `pico_ota.py` has been uploaded to the Pico  
3. It is recommended to enable a **2.4GHz mobile hotspot**, with both SSID and password set to `picobeth`; alternatively, create a `wifi.txt` file in the root directory to customize your Wi-Fi credentials:

   ```
   ssid=picobeth
   password=picobeth
   ```

### Instructions

1. When the progress bar appears during startup, press the **down** direction key to enter OTA mode  
2. Pico will attempt to connect to Wi-Fi  
3. Upon successful connection, it will retrieve the firmware list  
4. Use the direction keys to select a version and begin the update  
5. Once the update is complete, the device will automatically reboot  

> [!WARNING]
> If **retrieving the firmware list** in step 3 fails, it may indicate that **Pico’s Wi-Fi module has crashed**. Please **power off and restart** the device before trying again.

## Pre-Stretch System

Starting from **v2.92**, a new **Pre-Stretch Relax Value** customization feature has been added, making the pre-stretch operation more flexible.

### Feature Description

- Customizable relax value range: `0 ~ 9 LB` (previously fixed at `0 LB`)  
- Behavior similar to some high-end commercial stringing machines  
- Setting location: **Engineering Menu → 9-7 PS Relax Value**

### Comparison Explanation

#### ▸ Traditional Pre-Stretch (Default Relax Value 0 LB)  
> Assuming the target tension is 20 LB, and the pre-stretch is set to 10%

1. Pull to 22 LB  (pre-stretch)
2. Relax to 20 LB (target tension)

#### ▸ Relax Value Set to 5 LB  
> Assuming the target tension is 20 LB, pre-stretch is set to 10%, and relax value is set to 5 LB

1. Pull to 22 LB (pre-stretch)  
2. Relax to 15 LB (20 - 5)  
3. Pull back to 20 LB (target tension)
