1. Set LB  
2. Set KG  
3. Status Display  
4. PS = Pre-stretch Function, KT = Knotting Function  
5. Stringing Timer Time  
6. Constant-pull Status C = Enabled, M = Disabled  
7. Clip head movement speed: 1 = slowest, 9 = fastest  
8. Current Tension Value (Grams)  

### Tension Setting Screen

- Press the five-way button to enter tension setting mode. The first press displays the maximum tension with pre-stretch included. The second press adjusts the tension and pre-stretch.
- The pre-stretch function (PS) and knotting function (KT) can be toggled with the up and down buttons. After knotting, it automatically switches back to pre-stretch.

2. Maximum tension including pre-stretch  

### Tensioning Screen

- When the set tension is reached, the constant-pull mode is activated. Tension increases if it's too low, or decreases if too high, until tensioning mode is ended by pressing the button on the clamp head or the Exit button.
- Press the middle button of the five-way button to disable constant-pull. Press again to re-enable it.
- Pressing up or down adjusts tension by 0.5LB.

2. CP: Constant-pull on/off  
3. BZ: Buzzer on/off  
4. UN: Set LB or KG  
5. HX: HX711 Tension Sensor Calibration  
6. I: System Information  
7. T: Total Tension Count/Log  

### Detailed Log of Tensioning

![img_tslog](docs/img_tslog.jpg)

2. Tensioning Info: Set Value/Maximum Value  
3. Constant-pull increase/decrease counts  
4. Tension Coefficient  
5. If timing is enabled, shows time for this tensioning  
6. Pre-stretch % for this tensioning  
7. Tensioning seconds  
8. Tensioning count  

> [!NOTE]  
> By default, 1-50 log entries are displayed. To adjust, modify the LOG_MAX parameter. Setting it too high may cause memory issues.
