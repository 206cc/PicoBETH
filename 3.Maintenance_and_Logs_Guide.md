# Maintenance and Log Management Guide

## Maintenance

### Screw Maintenance

Observe for any abnormal vibrations or noises during each use. Visually inspect the screw's condition every month. Check for dust or other foreign substances on the screw and ensure sufficient lubrication. If yellowish-brown lubricating oil appears around the screw and the walking surface appears smooth, it indicates good lubrication. The recommended viscosity for the lubricating oil used in ball screw maintenance is 30~40 cSt.

### Parts Replacement

After replacing any components during maintenance, enter the hardware function testing mode at startup to retest all components for proper functionality.

**Usage:** When the version information appears at startup, press and hold the middle setting button until a long beep is heard, then release it.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you replace any hardware components, be sure to run **hardware function testing mode** to verify that all hardware functions are working properly.

### Factory Reset

You can restore the factory default settings without a computer by recreating the config.cfg file (the original configuration file will be renamed to config.cfg.bak). After restoring the default settings, make sure to recalibrate the HX tension parameters.

**Usage:** When the version information appears at startup, press and hold the exit button until a long beep is heard, then release it.

### Firmware Update

Please follow the steps below to update the firmware:

- **Back up all files from the Raspberry Pi Pico to your computer.**
- **Upload the new version of `main.py` to the Raspberry Pi Pico.**
- [**Perform hardware testing**](2.Hardware_Setup.md#hardware-function-testing-mode)
- [**Conduct reliability testing**](2.Hardware_Setup.md#reliability-testing-mode)
- **Test stringing with an old racket at least once.**

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> All of the above steps are crucial.

## Logging System

Starting from version V2.5, a simple logging system has been introduced to help with troubleshooting, recording important events, and facilitating future review and analysis.

### System Log `sys_log.txt`

This log file is viewable on a computer. You can customize the log's storage location using the built-in `logs_save()` function. When the log file reaches 100KB, the system will automatically rename and overwrite it.

**Format:**
```
Triggered function: Total tension count / Custom information
```

**Example:**
```
init(HX711):55863T/21188/21465/401/90
forward():55863T/No String?
start_tensioning():55863T/ts_err#0
forward():55863T/No String?
start_tensioning():55863T/ts_err#0
init(HX711):55863T/21188/21493/487/90
```

### Stringing Log `logs.txt`

This log can be viewed directly on the LCD screen. The maximum log value is defined by the `LOG_MAX` parameter.

**Format:**
```
Total tension count, Timer time, Tension unit, Set tension (LB), Max tension (G), Pre-stretch (%), Tension time, Number of tension increases, Number of tension decreases, Tension parameter, Tension calibration parameter, FT parameter, Knotting function SW, Knot (%)
```

**Example:**
```
60384,72719,1,21,10477,10,3,0,0,1.03852,18.17,1,0,15
60385,72736,1,22,10976,10,3,0,37,1.048519,18.17,1,0,15
60386,72753,1,23,11475,10,3,4,23,1.03852,18.17,1,0,15
60387,72770,1,24,11974,10,3,5,41,1.02852,18.17,1,0,15
60388,72785,1,25,12473,10,3,7,43,1.03852,18.17,1,0,15
60389,72803,1,26,12972,10,3,6,49,1.048519,18.17,1,0,15
```

### Reliability Testing Log `rt_logs.txt`

This log file is viewable on a computer. It automatically renames and overwrites when the test count reaches 1000.

**Format:**
```
Reliability test count / Total tension count / Automatic tension parameter / Test tension parameter / Tension completion time (seconds)
```

**Example:**
```
4521/60384T/1.03/0.97/13
4522/60385T/1.04/0.97/12
4523/60386T/1.05/0.97/13
4524/60387T/1.04/0.97/13
4525/60388T/1.03/0.97/12
4526/60389T/1.04/0.97/13
```
